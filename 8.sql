-- Kennedy Management System - Fix School Creation Policy for Signup
-- This script fixes the specific issue where school creation fails during signup
-- because the user is not authenticated yet

-- ============================================================================
-- THE PROBLEM
-- ============================================================================
-- During school + owner signup process:
-- 1. Frontend calls createSchoolAndOwner()
-- 2. First step: Create school (user NOT authenticated yet)
-- 3. RLS policy blocks school creation because no authenticated user
-- 4. Process fails with "new row violates row-level security policy"

-- ============================================================================
-- THE SOLUTION
-- ============================================================================
-- Allow unauthenticated school creation, but maintain security for other operations

-- ============================================================================
-- PART 1: DROP EXISTING SCHOOL POLICIES
-- ============================================================================

-- Remove all existing school policies that might conflict
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated users full access to schools" ON schools;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own school" ON schools;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Owners can update their school" ON schools;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow school creation for signup" ON schools;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Owners can delete their school" ON schools;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "System can create schools" ON schools;

-- ============================================================================
-- PART 2: CREATE NEW SCHOOL POLICIES THAT ALLOW SIGNUP
-- ============================================================================

-- Policy 1: Allow ANYONE to create schools (needed for signup process)
-- This is secure because:
-- - Only the signup process creates schools
-- - Immediate owner profile creation via trigger
-- - School is immediately "owned" by the new user
CREATE POLICY "Allow school creation during signup" ON schools
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);

-- Policy 2: Allow authenticated users to view their own school
CREATE POLICY "Allow users to view their school" ON schools
    FOR SELECT TO authenticated USING (
        -- Check if user has a profile with this school_id
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM profiles 
            WHERE profiles.id = auth.uid() 
            AND profiles.school_id = schools.id
        )
    );

-- Policy 3: Allow school owners to update their school
CREATE POLICY "Allow owners to update their school" ON schools
    FOR UPDATE TO authenticated USING (
        -- Only owners can update
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM profiles 
            WHERE profiles.id = auth.uid() 
            AND profiles.school_id = schools.id 
            AND profiles.role = 'owner'
        )
    );

-- Policy 4: Allow school owners to delete their school (if needed)
CREATE POLICY "Allow owners to delete their school" ON schools
    FOR DELETE TO authenticated USING (
        -- Only owners can delete
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM profiles 
            WHERE profiles.id = auth.uid() 
            AND profiles.school_id = schools.id 
            AND profiles.role = 'owner'
        )
    );

-- ============================================================================
-- PART 3: FIX PROFILES POLICIES TO AVOID RECURSION
-- ============================================================================

-- Remove any existing problematic profile policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated users full access to profiles" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view profiles in their school" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "System can create profiles" ON profiles;

-- Create safe profile policies
CREATE POLICY "Allow users to view their own profile" ON profiles
    FOR SELECT TO authenticated USING (id = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "Allow users to view profiles in their school" ON profiles
    FOR SELECT TO authenticated USING (
        school_id = (
            SELECT school_id FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid()
        )
    );

CREATE POLICY "Allow users to update their own profile" ON profiles
    FOR UPDATE TO authenticated USING (id = auth.uid());

-- CRITICAL: Allow system/trigger to create profiles during signup
CREATE POLICY "Allow profile creation during signup" ON profiles
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);

-- ============================================================================
-- PART 4: VERIFICATION
-- ============================================================================

-- Check that RLS is enabled
ALTER TABLE schools ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
