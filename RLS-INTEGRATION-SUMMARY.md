# RLS Organization and Integration - Summary

## Changes Made

### Integrated fix-rls-schools-error.sql into 05-row-level-security.sql

The standalone fix file has been fully integrated into the main RLS file to maintain the proper 01-06 file structure.

### Code Organization Improvements:

1. **Removed Duplicate GRANT Statements**
   - Consolidated all GRANT statements into the dedicated permissions section
   - Removed scattered grants that were mixed in with policy definitions

2. **Enhanced Anonymous User Permissions**
   - Added fallback UUID function grants for compatibility
   - Included error handling for missing functions
   - Comprehensive extension schema access

3. **Added RLS Policy Verification**
   - New verification section before policy validation
   - Checks for critical signup flow policies
   - Warns if essential policies are missing

4. **Cleaner Structure**
   - All policies grouped by table
   - All grants consolidated in one section
   - Clear separation between functionality blocks

### Key Fixes Integrated:

1. **Explicit Role Targeting**: Policies now specify `TO anon, authenticated`
2. **Extension Access**: Anonymous users can access UUID generation functions
3. **Fallback Support**: Handles both extensions schema and public schema UUID functions
4. **Policy Verification**: Automatic checking of critical policies

### File Structure Maintained:

- 01-extensions-and-types.sql
- 02-authentication-tables.sql  
- 03-business-tables.sql
- 04-authentication-functions.sql
- 05-row-level-security.sql (UPDATED with all fixes)
- 06-utility-functions.sql

The fix-rls-schools-error.sql file has been removed as it's no longer needed.

### Testing:

After running the updated 05-row-level-security.sql, the "new row violates row-level security policy for table schools" error should be completely resolved, and the signup flow should work properly.
