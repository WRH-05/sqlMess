-- Kennedy Management System - Fix Infinite Recursion in RLS Policies
-- This script fixes the circular dependency causing infinite recursion
-- Run this in Supabase Database > SQL Editor

-- ============================================================================
-- EMERGENCY FIX FOR INFINITE RECURSION IN RLS POLICIES
-- ============================================================================

-- The problem: RLS policies are trying to check school_id from profiles table
-- while creating profiles, causing infinite recursion
-- Solution: Temporarily use permissive policies for development

-- ============================================================================
-- PART 1: DROP ALL EXISTING PROBLEMATIC POLICIES
-- ============================================================================

-- Authentication table policies (causing recursion)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own school" ON schools;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Owners can update their school" ON schools;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "System can create schools" ON schools;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view profiles in their school" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view school profiles" ON profiles;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view invitations for their school" ON invitations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Owners and managers can create invitations" ON invitations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Owners and managers can update invitations" ON invitations;

-- Business table policies (might also cause issues)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can access students in their school" ON students;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can access teachers in their school" ON teachers;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can access courses in their school" ON course_instances;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can access course templates in their school" ON course_templates;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can access student payments in their school" ON student_payments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Managers and owners can access teacher payouts" ON teacher_payouts;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can access attendance in their school" ON attendance;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Managers and owners can access revenue" ON revenue;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can access archive requests in their school" ON archive_requests;

-- Any permissive policies from previous attempts
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations on schools" ON schools;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations on profiles" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations on invitations" ON invitations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations on students" ON students;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations on teacher_payouts" ON teacher_payouts;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations on revenue" ON revenue;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations on attendance" ON attendance;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations on archive_requests" ON archive_requests;
